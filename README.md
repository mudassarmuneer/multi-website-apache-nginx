# Multi-Website Deployment with Apache and Nginx Reverse Proxy

## Overview

This project showcases the successful deployment of multiple WordPress websites with distinct domains on a single server. The deployment leverages Apache as the web server and utilizes Nginx as a reverse proxy. The primary objective is to efficiently host multiple websites while ensuring optimal performance and security.

## Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project were as follows:

- **Configure Technology Stack:**
  - Set up Apache as the web server.
  - Implement MySQL for database management.
  - Integrate PHP for server-side scripting.
  - Utilize Nginx as a reverse proxy for efficient traffic distribution.

- **Secure Server Access:**
  - Establish a virtual machine on Ubuntu 20.04 with secure SSH key access for enhanced security.

- **DNS Configuration:**
  - Point DNS records for each domain/subdomain to the server's IP to facilitate proper routing.

- **WordPress Installation:**
  - Install WordPress and configure MySQL databases and users for each site to enable effective content management.

- **Apache Virtual Hosts:**
  - Establish Apache virtual hosts for each WordPress site to ensure efficient resource allocation.

- **Nginx Reverse Proxy:**
